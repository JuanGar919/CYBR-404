I believe the most important element in preparing for the career fair is the way you present yourself in front of employers. My original thought was communication or the way you dress since if you dress unprofessionally then you won’t be taken seriously. The same thing could be said if you don’t know how to speak to employers in a professional manner at the Career Fair. The way to get employers to remember you is to dress appropriately but not enough to blend in with everyone else and also being able to hold a conversation to explain your skills and past successes. I plan on wearing a color of tie that isn’t chosen very often to slightly stand out and as well as practice my introduction with other friends to get feedback.
